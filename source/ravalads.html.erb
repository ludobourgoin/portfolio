<h2>As a new advertising network company on the market, RavalAds needed a professional yet friendly brand identity, coming along with a modern and clean marketing website.</h2>

<h3 class="title">Wireframes ‚úèÔ∏è</h3>
<p>Most of the content lies on the home page. Above the fold content must include what RavalAds is, what it does and some social proof, in order to give the brand some credibility.</p>
<p>I then displayed major benefits of using RavalAds instead of alternative solutions, then I went with a more in-depth list of features.</p>
<p>The goal for RavalAds was clear: win the trust of prospective clients by providing a credible presentation of its services and features. The CTA directs a simple contact form.</p>

<h3 class="title">Brand Identity üé®</h3>
<p>As we are dealing with a B2B company here, we had to stick to a clean and minimalist interface, while trying to make the brand as friendly as possible so it's different from its competitors enough to be remarkable.</p>
<p>I decided to mix a stylish yet professional sans serif font (Ubuntu), with a warm and original purple and orange duo of colors.</p>
