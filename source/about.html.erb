    <p>Le passage ci-dessous r√©sume assez bien la raison pour laquelle le branding est si important de nos jours</p>
    <p>Among the hallmarks of a charismatic brand are a clear competitive stance, a sense of rectitud, and a dedication of aesthetics. Why aesthetics ? Because it's the language of feeling, and in a society that's information-rich and time-poor, people
      value feeling more than information.</p>
